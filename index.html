    <h2>What is cybersecurity?</h2>
    <p>Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These cyberattacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; extorting money from users; or interrupting normal business processes. Implementing effective cybersecurity measures is particularly challenging today because there are more devices than people, and attackers are becoming more innovative.</p>
    <h2>Why is cybersecurity important?</h2>
    <p>Cybersecurity is important because it protects all categories of data from theft and damage. This includes sensitive data, personally identifiable information (PII), protected health information (PHI), intellectual property, and governmental and industry information systems. Without a robust cybersecurity strategy, organizations cannot defend themselves against data breach campaigns, making them an easy target for cybercriminals. Effective cybersecurity measures help ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data, which is crucial for maintaining trust and operational stability in today's digital world.</p>
    <h2>What are the types of cybersecurity?</h2>
    <p class="para1">There are several types of cybersecurity, including:</p>
    <details>
        <summary><strong>Network Security:</strong></summary>
        <p>Protects the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of data as it is transmitted across or between networks.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary><strong>Application Security:</strong></summary>
        <p>Focuses on keeping software and devices free of threats. A compromised application could provide access to the data it is designed to protect.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary><strong>Information Security:</strong></summary>
        <p>Protects the integrity and privacy of data, both in storage and in transit.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary><strong>Operational Security:</strong></summary>
        <p>Includes the processes and decisions for handling and protecting data assets. The permissions users have when accessing a network and the procedures that determine how and where data may be stored or shared all fall under this umbrella.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary><strong>Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity:</strong></summary>
        <p>Defines how an organization responds to a cybersecurity incident or any other event that causes the loss of operations or data. Disaster recovery policies dictate how the organization restores its operations and information to return to the same operating capacity as before the event.</p>
